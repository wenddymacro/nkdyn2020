##### MAIN FILE #####

# This file executes the scripts used in the paper
# "Taylor rule(s) inflation", by E. Franceschi - PSE and Paris 1
# 
# The execution of the full batch of scripts requires
# a working version of Matlab equipped with Dynare.
# 
# The scripts executes the following tasks:
#		- gather data from several online sources,
#			compile a consistent dataset of time series.
#			This dataset is stored in csv format in './Processed data/US_data.txt';
#		- run a set of econometric tests and estimations 
#			over a given number of specifications of the 
#			Taylor rule, plotting results;
#		- simulate with Dynare 4 DSGE models, stock the inflation
# 			series and run the same econometric tests as the real inflation
#			data, plotting the AR properties of these models;
#		- solve and simulate the liquidity NKDSGE model with two monetary rules,
#			generate the IRFs; simulate the standard NKDSGE model for regular,
#			extremely aggressive and almost passive Central Banks. For all these
#			models and cases plot and compare IRFs.
#
#
# These scripts are not developed with code optimization in mind but result
# from modifications over time as the paper developed and changed. Higher speed
# might be easily achieved with vectorisation and parallelisation.

##### I - Flags, libraries, and folders #####

# Flagging
# make this interactive at the beginning of the 
# script

# 0 -- the code runs entirely, all different parts composed
# 1 -- when files are run singularily
flag___singular = 0

# 0 -- the code prints out all graphs
# 1 -- graphs are not printed but only produced and stored
flag___plot = 0

# 0 -- optimal lags for inflation are off
# 1 -- optimal lags for inflation are on
flag___optilag = 1

# 0 -- MsM estimation is off
# 1 -- MsM estimation is on, 2 states
# 2 -- MsM estimation is on, 3 states
flag___msm = 1
